A project to create and analyse the mathematically optimal Blackjack AI.  
https://www.profitsquad.co.uk/blackjack-strategy-how-to-play-perfect-blackjack/ This website (along with many others) describes a mathematically optimal strategy to playing Blackjack giving a chart for easy execution. Even after deploying this strategy, there is always a House Edge of 0.5%, so you win always lose on average 0.5% of your money.

This project is here to test this hypothesis. First I will play Blackjack using my best intuition (interpret that as you like) to play and then see the distribution of wins/losses that I achieve. Then I will make an AI that uses this optimal method and see if it achieves a better outcome today.  

First how to play Blackjack:


Second, some of the simplifications I've made to do this project:
